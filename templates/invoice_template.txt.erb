Attention: <%= name.capitalize %>'s Parents

Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name.capitalize %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name.capitalize %>'s Toy Order
=================
<% if behavior == 'naughty' -%>
<% subtotal = 100 -%>
$100  | 1 defective toy
<% end -%>
<% if behavior == 'nice' -%>
<% subtotal = 0 -%>
<% toys.each do |toy| -%>
<% if toy == 'Kaleidoscope' -%>
$0   | Kaleidoscope (out of stock)
<% else -%>
$<%= toy_price %> | <%= toy %>
<% subtotal += toy_price -%>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
----

$<%= subtotal %>   Subtotal
$<%= subtotal * 0.13 %>   HST
====
$<%= subtotal + (subtotal * 0.13) %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= subtotal + (subtotal * 0.13) %>. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name.capitalize %>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,
